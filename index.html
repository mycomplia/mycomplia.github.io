Syncing Complia with METRC is the most efficient way to manage your compliance data. The following METRC integration wizard will guide you through the process. If you have any questions, reach out to us for support at anytime (TeamComplia@mycomplia.com).
First, you will be asked to input your METRC API key. To access your API Key, click your badge number in the upper right corner of the screen to display the drop down menu. Select "API Keys" and click the Generate button. Finally, copy and paste this key into Complia.

It is important that the METRC key be generated by the METRC administrator for your business. If you're not sure who is your METRC administrator, contact METRC support at support@metrc.com.
Sync Licenses
Once your API key is registered in Complia, the next step is to sync your licenses. Complia will automatically link all existing licenses with those in METRC in cases where the license number is identical. Any licenses found in METRC that do not align with those in Complia will be created for you automatically. Once a license is linked between Complia and METRC, you'll see a little METRC icon next to the license.
Next, Complia will sync your strains. Complia will automatically link all existing strains with those in METRC in cases where the strain name is identical. Moreover, Complia will automatically group strains that may have different spellings but are actually the same strain. For example, if Complia identifies "AK-47" (with hyphen) in one license and "AK47" (no hyphen) in another license, Complia will automatically associate these two licenses under one strain name, AK-47. In other words, when you review your strain list in Complia, you'll see there is only one AK-47 strain. This will simplify viewing and accessing data associated with each strain.
Sync Strains
While you are syncing your strains, you'll notice a table which will indicate how many strains are created and how many strains a linked. A "created" strain is one that did not previously exist in Complia whereas a "linked" strain is one that has already been captured and is the same strain but with a different naming convention (such as the AK47 example above).
Sync Products (Items)
Once licenses are synced, Complia will sync products. Please note Complia will only link non-flower/trim products because contaminant process validation is product specific for infused products whereas process validation is license specific for flower/trim. Products will be synced just as strains were synced except for this exclusion. While Complia is capable of automatically determining product type for certain product categories, you will need to manually determine the product type for concentrates. Currently METRC does not differentiate between solvent and non-solvent based concentrates and this distinction plays a critical role in process validation analysis.
Sync Rooms
Finally, Complia will sync rooms just as it did strains and products. Once the wizard is complete, you'll be able to see all of the synced items on the license dashboard as well as on the strain, product, and room screens (under the laboratory analysis module).
If you have any trouble syncing with METRC, please contact us at TeamComplia@mycomplia.com.

Implications for Testing Compliance
It is important to note that Complia relies on your Strain and Product lists when performing testing compliance analysis.  So, if you create a new item every time you create a new batch, Complia will think you're actually creating a new item each time you create a new batch.  Complia recommends using standardized item names for each category of concentrate and each infused product you produce.  While you are welcome to use whatever naming conventions you choose, the METRC integration will prove less useful if you elect for a unique naming convention.
